Because of the inherently risky nature of acro, I wouldn't recommend doing it until you're healed enough to put weight on both arms again since you'll have a very difficult time catching yourself when things inevitably go south.
Even things as basic as bird can be dangerous when you only have one arm available.
Some people get head concussions from bird even with two healthy arms and years of experience.
Things just happen.
Besides, it places not only you but your partners at unnecessary risk.
Don't worry, your skills aren't just going to go poof out of nowhere while you're on break.
Just be patient.
Extreme acro with danger fan 

Haha, I was worried landing on the dog.
Your spotter is napping

Bene grazie!

Those ellipses had me worried you hit your feet on the fan!!
Awesome thanks

Yes!
The Orouborous flag parade.
It's a Dragon Flag Parade, but you switch base and flyer ( 'seesaw' ) in the bicep stand.
I'll post a video shortly.
Yes, you are correct.
I prefer the support-pose-free designation because it translates to other poses.
For example Star & free Star.
Supported Sidestar, Sidestar, standing Sidestar.
I call it 'needle' if the flyers hands are not touching the base at all.
There's debate over whether this is 'free' or not.
Thank you!!
That's an awesome resource.
When the flyer's hands are on the base's ankles it is supported shoulderstand.
Because acroyoga grew in such a decentralized manner, there are frequent name variations.
But it is helpful if we all start to agree on the terminology.
Walking up to a stranger to play and both understanding which pose you are about to attempt is one of the beautiful aspects of acroyoga.
According to the AcroYoga flight manual that I have this is free shoulderstand, and also according to acropedia.
https://www.acropedia.org/poses/free-shoulder-stand/

Do take a look at that link to look at the grip.
The flyers are maintaining rounded shoulders to allow for more surface area and control.
Also much healthier for wrists.
Really?
I always thought 'free shoulderstand' was just a shoulder stand where the fliers hands aren't using the bases ankles for balance

Good bot

Thanks for the advice!
:)

Not a free shoulder stand, but great form!
You may want your hands slightly more on her back, wrists are a bit sharp and you'll have more leverage for your fingers to balance her as she removes her hands.
Thumbs should be in line with your fingers, can't tell from this angle, just fyi.
Thanks for the tip!
I appreciate it.
Im still learning :)

You guys look like you are having fun.
That's great.
Technically, this is shoulderstand.
It is free shoulderstand when her hands are not holding on to you.
Also if you slide your hands more to her back, you won't feel her weight so much in your wrists.
But most importantly, you are having fun.
Thank you!!

Awesome!
You should get some padding around your tail bone, just a small blanket folded up or so.
2-4 inches thick.
It helps a lot with stability and will help you be able to straighten your legs more over time.
Sorry to hear about your friend.
Will definitely be careful.
Thank you!
First of all, great work!
It's awesome to start feeling progress like that.
:)

Second, y'all definitely need to find a larger space to practice in.
It doesn't look like you have enough space to fall safely in.
Maybe with very basic things you might be okay, but as you continue to challenge yourself it will become increasingly dangerous to not have the proper room to fall or roll out of failed attempts.
A friend of mine broke her neck due to a fluke getting up into something as simple as star because she was practicing with a friend in her living room where there wasn't the proper amount of room to tumble out of the trick.
Have fun and be safe!
Thank you!!
My girlfriend is a rock star.
She's an amazing teacher.
That's rather difficult for a beginner.
Nice!
Cossack squats!
I do these but didn't know the name for them.
Never thought of doing them with weight.
Brilliant.
Also, creepy alert...
I think we acro together?
Thank you!
Also consider googling assisted stretching near wherever you live.
Don’t get me wrong—I’m a yoga teacher and am a firm believer in yoga—but also assisted stretching (PNF, active release, etc) can be extremely beneficial when you have a specific goal like that.
And practice some basic acro with a mat or blanket folded a few times under your sacrum too!
Helps with tight hamstrings.
Great!
Thank you!
Go check out https://www.instagram.com/cirque_physio/?hl=en

Look back for her posts on hamstrings.
She has a lot of really good information.
Once you're done with that, head over to /r/flexibility, and check out some of the guides there as well.
Bodyweight or weighted Cossack squats and side planks too.
Adductors and abductors are key in L-baseing.
Roger that.
I enjoy barbell squats the different variations.
Thank you for replying!
Wow!
Awesome list.
Thank you so much for the information.
I will go through these movements!
I will look into this!
Gracias

Barbell squats will take you very far on their own.
Everything is easier and better the stronger you are.
Let the skill work take as long as it needs to.
