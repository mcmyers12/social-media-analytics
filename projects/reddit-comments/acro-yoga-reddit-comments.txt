Because of the inherently risky nature of acro, I wouldn't recommend doing it until you're healed enough to put weight on both arms again since you'll have a very difficult time catching yourself when things inevitably go south.  Even things as basic as bird can be dangerous when you only have one arm available.  Some people get head concussions from bird even with two healthy arms and years of experience.  Things just happen. Besides, it places not only you but your partners at unnecessary risk.  

Don't worry, your skills aren't just going to go poof out of nowhere while you're on break.  Just be patient.  

Extreme acro with danger fan 

Haha, I was worried landing on the dog.

Your spotter is napping

Bene grazie!

Those ellipses had me worried you hit your feet on the fan!!

Awesome thanks

Yes! The Orouborous flag parade.

It's a Dragon Flag Parade, but you switch base and flyer ( 'seesaw' ) in the bicep stand.

I'll post a video shortly.

Yes, you are correct. I prefer the support-pose-free designation because it translates to other poses. For example Star & free Star. Supported Sidestar, Sidestar, standing Sidestar.

I call it 'needle' if the flyers hands are not touching the base at all.

There's debate over whether this is 'free' or not.

Thank you!! That's an awesome resource.

When the flyer's hands are on the base's ankles it is supported shoulderstand. Because acroyoga grew in such a decentralized manner, there are frequent name variations. But it is helpful if we all start to agree on the terminology. Walking up to a stranger to play and both understanding which pose you are about to attempt is one of the beautiful aspects of acroyoga.

According to the AcroYoga flight manual that I have this is free shoulderstand, and also according to acropedia. https://www.acropedia.org/poses/free-shoulder-stand/

Do take a look at that link to look at the grip.  The flyers are maintaining rounded shoulders to allow for more surface area and control.  Also much healthier for wrists.

Really? I always thought 'free shoulderstand' was just a shoulder stand where the fliers hands aren't using the bases ankles for balance

Good bot

Thanks for the advice! :)

Not a free shoulder stand, but great form! You may want your hands slightly more on her back, wrists are a bit sharp and you'll have more leverage for your fingers to balance her as she removes her hands. Thumbs should be in line with your fingers, can't tell from this angle, just fyi.

Thanks for the tip! I appreciate it. Im still learning :)

You guys look like you are having fun. That's great. Technically, this is shoulderstand. It is free shoulderstand when her hands are not holding on to you. Also if you slide your hands more to her back, you won't feel her weight so much in your wrists. But most importantly, you are having fun.

Thank you!!

Awesome!

You should get some padding around your tail bone, just a small blanket folded up or so. 2-4 inches thick. It helps a lot with stability and will help you be able to straighten your legs more over time.

Sorry to hear about your friend. Will definitely be careful. Thank you!

First of all, great work! It's awesome to start feeling progress like that. :)

Second, y'all definitely need to find a larger space to practice in. It doesn't look like you have enough space to fall safely in. Maybe with very basic things you might be okay, but as you continue to challenge yourself it will become increasingly dangerous to not have the proper room to fall or roll out of failed attempts.

A friend of mine broke her neck due to a fluke getting up into something as simple as star because she was practicing with a friend in her living room where there wasn't the proper amount of room to tumble out of the trick.

Have fun and be safe!

Thank you!! My girlfriend is a rock star. She's an amazing teacher. 

That's rather difficult for a beginner. Nice!

Cossack squats! I do these but didn't know the name for them. Never thought of doing them with weight. Brilliant. 

Also, creepy alert... I think we acro together?

Thank you! 

Also consider googling assisted stretching near wherever you live. Don’t get me wrong—I’m a yoga teacher and am a firm believer in yoga—but also assisted stretching (PNF, active release, etc) can be extremely beneficial when you have a specific goal like that. And practice some basic acro with a mat or blanket folded a few times under your sacrum too! Helps with tight hamstrings.

Great! Thank you!

Go check out https://www.instagram.com/cirque_physio/?hl=en

Look back for her posts on hamstrings. She has a lot of really good information.

Once you're done with that, head over to /r/flexibility, and check out some of the guides there as well.


Bodyweight or weighted Cossack squats and side planks too. Adductors and abductors are key in L-baseing.

Roger that. I enjoy barbell squats the different variations. Thank you for replying!

Wow! Awesome list. Thank you so much for the information. I will go through these movements!



I will look into this! Gracias

Barbell squats will take you very far on their own. Everything is easier and better the stronger you are. Let the skill work take as long as it needs to. Get stronger and stretch everyday.

Since acroyoga grew out of yoga and many of the acro poses are yoga postures or inspired by yoga postures, a regular yoga practice is a good place to start. I and my friends who are bases and came to acro from a consistent yoga practice didn't have as much of the tight hamstring issues that some other bases (often men) have. Try attending a class once or twice a week.

Otherwise, here's a list of yoga postures/stretches that help with tight hamstrings and hip mobility. I would google them and watch some instructional videos to do them in good form and get the most out of them. 

* Pyramid pose (parsvotanasana)

* Half-splits (ardha hanumanasana)

* Triangle pose (trikonasana)
* Standing forward fold (uttanasana)
* Seated forward fold and one-legged forward fold
* Wide-legged standing forward fold (prasarita something)
* Standing splits
* Skandasana

* Happy baby for the hips and lower back
* Half-pidgeon because everyone loves half pidgeon

The key to getting a good hammy stretch is to engage your legs. If it's a standing posture, push your leg to straight, taking out as much bend as possible in the leg you're trying to get a hammy stretch in. Seated postures like seated forward fold, focus on pushing the back of your knee into the ground. 


Hip openers and vinyasa flows to build your endurance and hip stability. It will loosen your hamstrings, improve your hip mobility, and get your Body used to moving. 

Woww, I liked a lot! I will try;)

Nice to see you on reddit Nathan. 
I’ll be there !

Come to Austin!

Really excited for this, if you have any questions let me know. 

This is a brand new format I'm trying to help give back to aspiring and current artists across the US. 

Amazing!

holy guacamole! [very well done!](https://media.giphy.com/media/7rj2ZgttvgomY/giphy.gif) 

I do like Robert Li's line. We talked about it briefly and it's such a great idea! I'm super happy he's designing and will be selling. 

I was going to comment about Robert Li but see that he is mentioned. Ditto to that 

Holy crap. Who's up for 30?

Welcome let me know how it goes 

I prefer to base a two-high with my flyer having straight legs because it is easier to convince them not to try to balance themselves that way. And it is much easier to base one leg two high if the leg is straight. Of course, you are correct that what matters from a structural point of view is the connection between foot / shoulder and head / shins. In order to have straighter legs, the flier's foot must be more forward on the base's shoulders and their heels have to be more up (but still together). When teaching, I will recommend that pairs try both ways. 

(A small side note, but I do base three high, and my middle base keeps straight legs.) 

There are a number of ways to do the transition, but if you are stepping in one foot at a time (with or without a small pop), and you are having trouble losing the balance forward or to the stepping side, I would probably also suggest trying with straighter legs. Not that it is the only right way, but it might be better for you. 

I do not know your level or the technique you are working on, so this is not advice for you, but my progressions for this move are:

1. Solid two high
2. Hands free two high
3. One leg two high, base holding the supporting leg, flyer lifting the free leg up and to the front with a bent knee. This should be stable and easy on both sides before progressing.
4. Base reaches for flyer's foot from previous position and guides it down to the foot to hand position, then guides it back up to the one-leg position. This should be smooth before progressing. 
5. Same as 4, but instead of guiding the foot back, flyer lifts the leg from the shoulder to a 1-foot balance in the base's hand, and the base reaches for the free foot and guides it down. 

In practice, this is quicker and not so exaggerated as that - you don't have to lift the legs all the way or hold the one-foot balances, but they need to be solid so you can move through them confidently. 





I based a lot of 2 high to F2H, it's always been microbends because the shin HAS to rest against the back of the head. Then you keep one hand on while you transition the first foot and then move to the second foot. 

Have never heard of the microbend... Feel like it would happen naturally when shins are against head... Since the head is not there for the f2h, feel like they would be straight. There's acro yoga, Dutch, circus, cheer and gymnastic ways to get through most elements... Try all of them and go with what looks, feels the best... And others can fuck right off if they don't like it.

There's no one right way to do this stuff. Some bases and flyers prefer straight legs for two highs. Personally I like the bend - you'll never get a three-high if you don't have that bend!

If what you're doing works for you, and isn't dangerous, keep doing what you're doing. If someone tries to force their way on you, tell them that you appreciate their input but are doing what works for you and what you were taught.


Thanks for sharing. Going to show this to my acro partner to learn this routine 😊

I learned a ton from YouTube. There are some great instructor videos that give you the basic while also getting the technique across so you can eventually move to harder stuff.

My girlfriend and I want to learn as much As we can in a short period of time. Luckily she’s a former gymnast and I’m reasonably fit. Do you have a favorite resource that helped to learn with your partner/group at home?


He's currently in Mexico City, and has been given a 5 year ban from reentering the US.

We are all very hopeful that we can get this situation resolved. Thanks so much for helping and sharing.

So yes there are couples who practice just with each other, and those couples tend to be at the absolute top of the game. Although playing with a wider variety of people can bring a wider variety of skillset and knowledge it also decalibrates you to existing partners. Playing with just one person brings an extreme level of calibration and allows you to work towards more extreme skill sets at a faster rate. 

That being said, unless you are working higher level skills or wish to use those skills professionally, there is no reason to be acro-exclusive as it robs you of connection with the community.

Asking your partner to focus more time on playing with you is totally understandable. Asking her to stop playing with other people because you're jealous will cause a problem.

Now, that being said, if her ex's are wanting to setup private play sessions where you aren't invited or are speaking to her in a romantic way, that is different. If someone is trying to make the moves on your partner in a normal non-acro context it is important not to confuse that with simply playing.

Finally, incidental butt and boob grabs do not happen all the time.

Spotters should be spotting hips and shoulders, not tits and ass. I see butt and boobs grabs the most when people are learning acro and don't know how to catch the flyer. If you grab someone's genitalia or boobs without prior consent it is important to acknowledge it and apologize. (There are a moves that require butt grabs but those should be communicated in advance)

great picture.    beautiful setting. 

I think you nailed it! Well done

Your welcome 
Agreed 

Thanks for sharing. <3 we need more of this.

Beautiful form!! Love how your legs echo each other’s direction perfectly. <3 

There is no space where sexuality doesn't exist, this is true from the prison to the monastery.  To deny it exists in an acro yoga class is pointless. I think the extent to which it exists, or which components of sex exist, depend on perception and the nature of your sexuality. 

In my experience, acro yoga does not feel as sexual as it appears. Still, there is a visual component to sex, and a biomechanical component to sex, and traces of both are found to some extent in acro yoga, along with factors like sensuality. The physical interplay that is characteristic of acro yoga is typically only seen in dance and sex, so another association with sex may be made through the appearance of that dynamic. 

There is an assumption that an absence of an erection is an indication of an absence of arousal, this is false. There are levels and types of arousal, such as desiring, directed attention, approach, erection, ejaculation, etc. Regardless of intent, life is intermittently sexual, and it's not very sex positive to deny this. It's best that people accept that, rather than preach about a puritanical space or existence. Many people are aroused by the female form, while the female form in sexual positions is unsurprisingly particularly arousing to many people too. So it's understandable if you perceive sex in your partner straddling a man's face, or her legs wide open inches from his face. 

I admit that I have seen women with attractive bodies in erotic positions, and it wasn't a repulsive sight. Some women have been dressed in such a manner that they were intimately exposed, and that just felt awkward, although I'm not going to pretend that the female form isn't appealing in different ways.

Having said that, actually pairing with a woman in acro yoga does not feel like a sexual interaction. I am aware from dance that it is a matter of sexual pride for some men to lead a woman, and this may be the case for some in acro yoga too, but associations between leading and sexual prowess are too tenuous to warrant much attention.

Another issue to touch on is touch. It's not normal in Western culture to have someone you're unacquainted with enter your personal space and start touching you extensively while in a leisure setting, or at least non-medical or therapeutic. So, this is bound to raise questions. The touching does feel impersonal to me though, and my concern is showing competency and respect.

Away from the anonymity of places like Reddit, people won't often readily display their most private thoughts, so you can't account for what someone's intent is. Perhaps it's best to focus on your partner; discuss boundaries, but be open to the possibility that the nature of her sexuality may genuinely prevent her from perceiving the activity as sexual. 

Good luck anyway

I thought it was first coined in california?

Yes. They also host events such as AcroLove. 

I'm in a similar situation, I don't have a certification. Me and my friend just want to teach the fundamentals of the practice, principally for beginners. We already have some experience with jams. How do you think that this kind of class must be lead and what acros must be teach?

Thanks ;)   
And how about acroyoga international? Is it just another school of acroyoga?   


I’ve had to deal with a good amount of harassment and unwanted situations as a leader in my community. Making sure people (mostly men) know that Acroyoga is not a way to hit on others can be a real problem. Also teaching the difference between encouragement and bullying is important. I could go on forever with this subject.

Did this beginning of January. While I felt like I was making no progress doing it... I actually grew so much strong after and didn’t notice until  taking a small break after the 12 days. I hit some breakthroughs . Totally recommend committing to it. 

Acroyoga Montreal was the first group to coin the phrase acroyoga. It's a school of acroyoga like others, with its own philosophy and style of teaching. As far as I can tell acrovinyasa is just acroyoga with a different trademarked name. 

Woww, it's a dream!

Unfortunatelly I'm so far, certanly it will be an incredible experience.  Enjoy and tell us how it was.

Note that the FB group also has videos explaining some of the drills.

Thank you! It's a tricky art that takes a lot of mistakes to get better but it's a remarkably similar process to yoga. It's all in the balance of learning to let go just enough and consistent practice.

Wowww, very beautifull. The litlle guy arriving it was amazing. Congratulations! 

Is it very difficult to do some video like this? I wanna say about edition and recording...

Wow, congrats! I am mainly a base, but by no means a large one and always try to base some of the larger bases I know to show the same thing about shape/size, but also because they don't get to fly that often! Everyone should fly! 

Fun! I wish my sisters would do acro with me. 

The thing that helped me the most was doing swivels while in bird. Stretches each hamstring while also being in a position that requires strength to slow the swivel and then accelerate it in the opposite direction. Flexibility is one thing, but mobility is what is most important!

I've been to jams in several different communities that are combined jams with other practices. Ours here is combined with a drum circle, hoop jam, juggling jam, and also staff!

Thanks friends ;) It's clear for me now. The idea to make a picnique is very good  too. I think would be good also invite people to practice other practices like Acrobatic tissue and slackline.

How jams are implemented can be very different in different communities. I have been to some where it is a chance to practice outside and people stay isolated, in their dedicated partnerships. I have been to others, where it is closer to a potluck picnic/social gathering with a bit of acro on the side. Sometimes people wait to be invited in, and if there is an outgoing, inclusive attitude, that will work. Some jams get very trick-heavy. The only way to find out what the 'philosophy' of a particular jam is, will be to attend it.

The word “jam” comes from the music world, where musicians gather together to practice in a casual, informal way.  “Hey, let’s grab our guitars and jam this weekend.”  

It’s used the same way in the acroyoga world.  

It is probably the best way to meet people, yes.

A jam is a group of people coming together to do acroyoga. Generally there's no particular instructor or class.



Haha - thanks!  I’m really not - I’m 95% flyer - but the first person I was ever willing to base is my own most regular base because we were so well calibrated i tristes i wouldn’t drop and hurt him.  That kind of made me want to base mainly people significantly bigger than me to help show acro is not about shape or size!

Wow you are a great base!

Practice basing people (or objects like chairs/piece of cloth/rubber band) with just one leg while the other leg stays parallel as you can to the floor. This position will isolate your hamstrings by preventing your pelvis from tilting. [http://jomcrae.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HamstringsStrapBentLeg-640x4801-400x300.jpg](http://jomcrae.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HamstringsStrapBentLeg-640x4801-400x300.jpg)

Stretch! Follow along with any hamstring flexibility guide, like the ones posted in /r/flexibility/

While you're working on stretching, place a rolled up mat or a blanket under your sacrum, to elevate your lower back. It'll make things easier.

Follow cirque_physio on instagram - she's doing a series on hamstrings right now.


This was me for 2 years before I hurt my lower back due to something unrelated (bad chair at work).  Before that, I kept my sacrum off the floor and was fine doing even advanced acro.  After the back pain started though, I couldn't keep my hips off the floor anymore since it hurt too much.  So I finally started to stretch my hamstrings hardcore for a month, twice a day everyday, and finally got to the point where I could keep my hips on the floor.  Still got a lot more work to do on the hamstrings but it's gotten much better.  

Armstring flexibility. That's really what it comes down too, the more flexible you'll be, the easier it will be to keep your butt on the ground.

Being mindful of it also helps. For the first couple of months, it was still much harder/exhausting to base while keeping my sacrum on the ground, so I was lifting my butt without thinking about it. But eventually, through practice, you'll get there.

But if you do some yoga / stretching, you'll improve much faster :)

Just kept going to my regular class!

Rob Li is creating a clothing line specifically for acro. designkontrol also does something similar, but most of the acro clothing I have is just yoga clothing that works well for acro; it is hard to find something that satisfies all needs though 

Have you tried doing exactly what you did starting from belly basing? I would figure it would be slightly easier since after the roll you would just be pushing them up to throne?

You didn't pick a light flyer to start with :-) Go you!

Most people find L-basing H2H's harder. They are a bit safer though. But it sure looked like OP had enough spotters :-)

How was it?

Cool :-)  


Spotter needs to be closer and spot at the hips or shoulders though. Grabbing the flyer's leg doesn't keep their face from the ground.

Best, most specific advice you're going to find from a physiotherapist that specializes in circus. 

https://www.cirquephysio.com/the-hyperextension-dilemma/

That's kind of what I figured, Thank you

I figured that you should keep it straight without hyperextending but I didn't really consider b. thank you

If you have hyper mobility you should never lock out your joints with any weight. Period. With hyper mobility your tendons are all that’s holding your joint together instead of your muscles and tendons. When your tendons stretch they don’t unstretch. Overstretched tendons can lead to a myriad of issues including lifelong pain and surgery. 

I have knees that over-extend (past straight anyway) and I've been told to hold them straight so as to not further stretch them. This is born out by experience that if I don't hold them straight, a) pain develops after a while and b) they can get "stuck" backward if I don't have enough strength to pull them back into alignment.

Echoing what other users are saying - you REALLY need to find a jam/workshop to get started.  Many intro positions are shockingly difficult.  I'm probably [solidly intermediate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i15HYUngbxE) now, after a couple hundred hours in; the linked routine is a beginner-level routine, and totally-new-to-the-sport people typically can't do that full routine after 4+ hours, even with an experienced base/flyer.  
  
I want to be real clear that "not able to do it" means "falling over" - so if you try to learn from the internet (or others), you are going to get some falls.  Some of those are gonna be bad ones...  
  
Generally, nowadays, I neglect the use a spotter only when doing things that I've done a number of times before, when both people are accepting a "worst case" fall, and with moderately experienced people.  Moderately experienced people know how to a) fall and b) look out for the other person when falling (primary source of injury is smashing into the other person).  That said, I'm *very* durable from a history in gymnastics/parkour.  
  
A good 10 hours of jam/workshop will go a long way for people already very experienced (you guys), but is really going to be pretty mandatory to proceed without injury - acro can be a dangerous sport for a novice.  After 10 hours (bird, r-bird, side-star, full star, reverse star), if you feel like you can proceed safely without direct instruction, go for it.  That said, much of the fun of acro (and tango) is playing with others, teaching, and creating something together; I'd advise being part of your local acro (or swing dance) group for those reasons alone.

I like wearing tights as a guy but you have to be careful which kind you get. Lots of mens athletic tights are made with a breathable mesh material that is totally see thru when your legs are split. 
Womens tights are way better but my cock bulge is ridiculous in those things and im not sure if thats cool or not. Anyone have thoughts on that? I dont want people to think im a wierd creepy guy

Acrobatique has an online certification and Acrobatic Arts has an amazing program too !
They plan out the lessons and help you with tutorials!
Has really helped my students progress quickly 

Tier 1: find your community. You will do best working with an experienced spotter. Also it often is easier to learn with an experienced partner, and then practice with your SO.

Tier 2: make a community. If you don't have one on hand, you can only go so far. But if you build it, they will come. Find acrobats on Instagram who may be traveling around and ask if they'd teach a workshop. You can use pretty much any park as a venue.

Tier 3: YouTube. I'm all for internet learning, but for the love of god grab another friend (or a couple if no one wants to third wheel) and make sure your are SAFE. Learning acro is a 3 person ordeal. 

I Learned basically with one other person, it's challenging without instruction but basically find a list of skills and try them.
A lot of acro community is very casual with training so if you approach with an active and focused mindset, you can progress very quickly.
Warm up, do calibration drills, smash out reps of basic skills, focusing on consistency, ease and control, then work harder skills.  https://youtu.be/LFWBbeY7SQQ. 
make sure your flier learns how to break fall. During a training session my flier will fall roughly 50-80 times, if they don't know how to come down safely they will hurt themselves.

Having even a little training at the start is helpful as it will prevent bad habits from forming and give you an idea of where you want to take your training. There's a LOT of minor things that make a big difference, so trying to get self taught is like wanting to learn gymnastics by yourself, it's doable but you may injure yourself and will hinder progress. Get some basics and carry on the training on your own.

There are some nice beginner acro tutorials on youtube! Also, if she's a dancer, then her flexibility is probably pretty decent - but if you do a lot of runnong, yours may not be. Work on stretching out your hamstrings and hips, and that will help you lots if you plan on basing her. 

There are some very good tutorials on youtube.  But for safety, it'd be better to learn in person, especially with spotters who know what they're doing.  Copying things you see and attempting them yourself without the basics mastered is a recipe for injury. 

Look into finding your local community, check Facebook for acroyoga and your city or region! Besides this, acropedia is a great resource, albeit a bit disorganized...

Those seem like decent options. Thanks!

I’m in Reno!


The two answers I see are both spot on.  Great community, but sometimes a little over-enthusiastic.  I would try to find someone around your size with a little bit more experience to pair with.  Get a spot on basically everything if it's your first time trying a pose.  

Say thank you instead of sorry, because it makes people feel good instead of making you feel bad.  "Thanks for catching me" instead of "Sorry I fell on you."  

What city are you in? I don't know what all the communities are like, but most are super friendly and a little bit hippy.  

As a base, I love Vuori shorts. I've ripped out the crotches/butts of a number of shorts before I found them and bought a number of pairs. They're also great because, depending on which ones you buy, they can double as a bathing suit.

Oh I've done this before. Dance belts get real sweaty and uncomfortable real fast.

The women's short seems like a good idea, I'll try that.

I just wear "women's" yoga pants or shorts. If you're worried about decency, throw on a dance belt.

I've found that VSX tights are reasonably grippy (as a flyer). Can't say the same for their shorts though, those things slip right off base feet, especially for pops.

Please be aware that acro can be dangerous no more so than when inexperienced people are involved.  I hope your community is welcoming but some times people can become a bit careless when a new fit person shows up.  When they are suggesting posses for you to you should ask them to take you through the most basic variations first and seek out a third person to spot you. This goes for flying and basing, having someone fall on you hurts just as much as being dropped.  You should probably reject most offers to do standing poses if you don't already have a background in cheerleading or so other foam of stunting. It is way safer to learn poses low and build confident and knowledge before going to high standing poses. 

TL:DR There are tons of super safe beginners poses, make sure you are not being thrown into more advanced moves too soon, there will be plenty of time for that down the road. 

Maybe look at crossfit brands. Reebok make decent crossfit appropriate clothing, which I find doubles up pretty well for my Acro needs. 

Lots of hugs. We fucking love hugs. These are the friendlies people I've ever met. Have fun meeting everyone.

You might spend more time flying but you could base smaller people just fine. If you are good at weighted squats and have flexible legs you might be better at basing than you would think.

If you don't have experience being upside down you will have a fun new experience flying.

Enjoy!

I just took my first class the other day. I’m a smallish female and went with my boyfriend and I flew him with no issues. Strength isn’t a huge factor. 

I want men's shorts built with L-basing in mind. No draw string, belt loops, bunched up elastic, or fat seams. Just smooth and flat in the back. Put the elastic and string or whatever somewhere else. No back pockets. No zippers. No velcro.

After a few hours of having 100-200 pounds stacked on top of my sacrum I'm very aware of how much my pants are digging into me. It's quite painful.

A particular pair of Manduka shorts is the best I've found. The draw string is very flat. They're also not too long and are snug on my legs so when I roll them up for thigh stands they stay put. Prana tries, some of theirs have good flat waistbands, but they do a terrible job with their men's sizing and the bastards seem to love frivolous pockets.

Thanks for the link. We travel fulltime and try to drop in on jam sessions or classes whenever and wherever possible. 

Fixed. :)

Wow, no.


I just did a 3\-day elemental immersion \(8\-hr days can get intense\) last weekend and it was incredible. All the teachers mixed with a community of acroyogis from around the country helped to contribute to a safe learning environment. Regardless of different levels, it was apparent that all their skill levels increased considerably. Whether it was confidence or just learning new things, it was extremely helpful. 

There were some who sounded like they were in your position \- flatlining in progress in their own small communities \- but at the end, it sounded like they didn't regret it at all and they had a wealth of knowledge to work on back home at the end.

No please tell me it does not say that. 

Oh my Lordy it does....

“Yoga could keep your figure.
Especially girls, keep good figure is beneficial not only for health, but also for your future jobs, marriage and family…”

Excuse me??

Why is this in /r/acroyoga

"The body is your temple. Keep it pure and clean for the soul to reside in."

"Amazing abs"

To be honest, we don't have insurance since Japan is not a litigous society and I'm not even sure where to begin to look for Japanese insurance.  If you're in the states, I would recommend having it though since even if your members are unlikely to sue you, their insurance companies might.     

I also had the same worries about what people would think if we started charging, but it turns out most people are more than happy to chip in since they understand you are giving up your time to organize and teach.  Some people even feel bad for taking a class without paying.  Keep it something reasonable and people will not mind.  If you don't like handling cash in person (like me), you could just put a folder or envelope somewhere so people can put their money into and then they can sign in by themselves on a piece of paper.  Makes it less like a business transaction and just as a part of following the rules.  Keep it casual and friendly and likely nothing will change.    

I forgot to share my own. When I first started one of my friends was dropped on their head, \(they're fine but it hurt for a few weeks\) the person they were with was also very inexperienced and they were doing something they shouldn't have been. Also at the first festival I went to someone dislocated a knee cap. Other than those two incidents I haven't seen any accidents in Acro in the 2\+ years I've been doing it.

As for harassment, I'm not aware of any in my immediate community but I'm also a guy so I'm not sure if I would be informed if it were an issue. There was an invitation to privately share bad experiences at a jam once and nothing came of it so maybe it is fine? But we also have a small community so it likely is not representative.

I'm curious how widespread bad experiences are. What are peoples personal experience with Acro and safety/harassment? 

Thank you! 

I'm definitely leaning towards not doing a training, especially because I already teach the basics every week and don't plan on teaching more advanced things in a class setting anytime soon.

Thanks for the detailed response.

Did you actually get insurance?

Another worry of mine is that right now everything is free so I'm very curious what charging will change.

1. I was/am in a similar position with the exception that I live fairly close to a large acro scene. I have taught beginner lessons in a variety of situations and they have been fairly well attended and popular. Overall I would say it has been successful. 

2. I teach with a friend who has a yoga qualification and that covers us. It is possible a cheaper and easier option.

3. never seen anyone use a waiver at any jams or workshops (once at a convention though) so I dont think it is necessary, however it cant hurt right? (Where I live a spoken agreement is as valid as a signed waiver though)

4. No, many of my friends have and I dont rate it. It seems to be run solely to make money and all the teachers that come back are basically the same as when they went, but with a little more arrogance. 

Running at a profit and using it to buy equipment/ cover slow weeks is the norm round me. Feel free to reply/message me if you have any other questions

I'm an organizer of an acroyoga community in Tokyo.  

I was basically in your exact position 2 years ago.  I started off with making events on Meetup.com and leading classes by myself, with all money being donation based.  However, I discovered pretty quickly that it's pretty hard to teach both beginners and intermediates at the same time without alienating one or the other.  

So eventually I partnered up with my friend who had the same experience level as me so that one person led the beginners and the other person led the intermediates.  We swap places every session to avoid burnout.  Advanced people have the option to join the intermediate lesson or just jam on their own.  We rent out studio space that provides yoga mats/crash mats so that members don't have to bring their own.  

We charge $10 per session which seemed to be the sweet spot for us to cover rent while being cheap enough for members to come back long term.  We don't make any profits from this since the extra money is used to cover expected losses from days with low attendance.  

You can find some good insurance advice on the "Safety in Acro" Facebook group by using the search function.

Neither of us have an acroyoga-specific teaching certification but we both have personal trainer certifications and are school teachers in our day jobs.  Out of the 400 people we've taught, noone has ever asked or even cared if we had a teaching certification.  

Hey thanks for taking the time to share!

Here are some recurring ones I know about:
- AcroCamp in Illinois
- AcroFest Chicago
- Interfusion DC
- AcroShare Tennessee

No yoga needed, strength is good, coordination is better, some flexibility doesn't hurt. But your attitude to improve is what's most important. Show up to a beginner jam and see how you go.

Thank you so much. I’m from Miami and I found a jam for beginners in south point park,  I will go for sure and try. You were very helpful 

You don't have to have any yoga experience to do acro.  You'll learn what you need on the journey.  (That said, yoga is great and I think everyone should do it)

Dont worry about headstands, shoulder stands or handstands, there is plenty you can do without those, and those skills will develope as you go.

Arm strength will develope as you go as well, if you get started and you're finding some muscle weaknesses that are hampering your practice then you can work on building those.

Bottom line: acro, In one form or another, is for every body. Start where you're at.

How to start: find classes or workshops near you.  Find a local jam and just go, the community is super friendly and accommodating just tell them you have no experience and want to learn and you'll either start learning or get direct to the ways to learn.
Worse case: find a partner, watch videos on YouTube, and slowly work your way through.

Worry about getting solid at the basic poses before you start going for transitions and washing machines.

And above all have fun

Without being sarcastic, probably just basic statistics. A community with a thousand people is more likely to have at least 1 incident than a community of a dozen

> As the popularity of AcroYoga grows, more people are getting hurt, serious injuries become more common, and as in the larger yoga community, abuse, harassment, and sexual assault occurs. 

Where are the numbers for this coming from?

Haha, now this is epic! =D

Answer is simple - go to acrobatic festivals or try to find another community nearby. Or both.

This is [one place to start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEUWlhXL1ao), and there are more available to purchase from the acroyoga.org website.

Also been there, got bored and stopped for a few months, then came back and other people had progressed and I had more strength (from other sports) so started crushing some harder sequences and am really enjoying it now. All I would say is that if you do take a break keep up with any specific stretches and strength training (hand strength or hamstring flexibility etc) you need to save you self the hassle of having to regain it instead of maintaining.

Best of luck

No worries! thanks for playing!

I presented it to see what people can come up with.

I think we've all been there. For me, it was quite a while that I felt that way. The thing that changed for me was seeking out new transitions and trying to just create stuff.

Forget about the washing machines you know for a bit. Get in a pose, have someone call out a new one, and figure out how to get there! This is how I came up with the whale to star challenge I posted here a few days ago.

Trying to be creative in my practice has really been a game changer for me. I no longer get 'bored' because there's alway something "stupid" I can try.

Note: There's "good stupid" and "bad stupid". I stick to the good stupid!

The immersions can be costly, though you can reach out and talk to the organizers about possible work trades. Another possible route is attending Acro Festivals, they are usually weekend long with SO many options, and much more affordable than a week long immersion.

There's a facebook group dedicated to compiling a list of all the acro festivals! I teach at most of the east coast fests and Divine Play, let me know if you have any questions about them.

I haven't tried thai massage yet. I will check it out. 

> You could also add in a lot of Thai massage.

Incredible 

Body poster 

You could try some other movement practices that can be integrated - like contact improvisation or regular acrobatics.

Have you fully explored the therapeutic side of acroyoga? You could also add in a lot of Thai massage.

Yes.  Venturing out from your community will improve your game.  Bettter yet. Take someone with you!

I totally missed the instruction that said at most 1 intermediate pose so we flow through a few :P 

oh thanks! last year we did a washing machine with this "ballerina step" so it was a bit familliar. if you like to watch (at '0:25) https://youtu.be/Gq9gImmhQU8

Oh I like it! Very similar, but the cross step in whale was different. Nice job.

haha very similiar to the one we did: https://youtu.be/LK5-TuceuWs

okay, working on it lol

Link doesn't work for me :(

that's me basing while training. its been a little while though!

Heyyyyyy friend!!! :D

I'm one of the bigger guys in my community so not many chances to fly, but I'm a skydiver & love spending my time flying head down, so would love to be able to fly haha! But your right, we have a "harder job" 🙄 don't think my partner would appreciate me saying that haha 

Dont be sad! I'm a base!! We have the harder job! We have to keep them alive!

I appreciate the feedback! Sadly I'm the one basing it .. was my flyers first time as well flying standing H2H though! 

I'm not giving you a hard time you look great!! What it really comes down to is comfort so listen to your base if its mor comfortable for both of you go for it! You're doing awesome for so little time flying!

Can someone show pics of whale and star? Im mostly a standing acro human and play with l basing but I don't know names...

Yeh I didn't know where to comment, were both rock climbers so we have pretty strong wrists but he has a weaker wrist than mine & he tends to over bend it which then hurts my wrists. So we've found this position to be more slightly more comfortable (but I wouldn't do this with anyone else) a good palm to palm is much better and more comfortable otherwise. I've only been doing acro for about a month so give me some time to adjust ;) 

Oh what? It's easier on the floor? 
Yes of course I practiced them L basing on the ground first. 

Thanks!

Whale to reverse star is easy.....the challenge was to do something that wasn't easy.

Yes, a 180 twist is involved in the way we did it.


Do you mean Whale to reverse star or are in envisioning a full 180 twist as well?

I hope by first you mean your first Standing H2H. It is pretty reckless for your first H2H to be standing. 

Try it! I'll show you mine if you show me yours!

this i gotta see... ;)


So much fun!! I love H2H! Watch your wrists though because they're so flat. Check your grip with your porter and try to adjust the grip to be less damaging on your wrists. Your hands should be locked so the heel of your thumb is supporting the weight rather than your wrist. Great handstand form up there!!

Really like it good work!

haha - good one!
