		Because of the inherently risky nature of acro, I wouldn't recommend doing it until you're healed enough to put weight on both arms again since you'll have a very difficult time catching yourself when things inevitably go south.  Even things as basic as bird can be dangerous when you only have one arm available.  Some people get head concussions from bird even with two healthy arms and years of experience.  Things just happen. Besides, it places not only you but your partners at unnecessary risk.  \

		It's a Dragon Flag Parade, but you switch base and flyer ( 'seesaw' ) in the bicep stand.\

		Yes, you are correct. I prefer the support-pose-free designation because it translates to other poses. For example Star & free Star. Supported Sidestar, Sidestar, standing Sidestar.\

		I call it 'needle' if the flyers hands are not touching the base at all.\

		There's debate over whether this is 'free' or not.\
